Although several studies have focused on encoding a skeleton, less attention has been paid to incorporating this information into the latent representations of human action. This work proposes a learning framework for action recognition, InfoGCN, combining a novel learning objective and encoding method. First, we design an information bottleneck-based learning objective to guide the model to learn an informative but compact latent representation. To provide discriminative information for classifying action, we introduce attention-based graph convolution that captures the context-dependent intrinsic topology of human actions. In addition, we present a multi-modal representation of the skeleton using the relative position of joints, designed to provide complementary spatial information for joints. InfoGCN surpasses the known state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks with the accuracy of 93.0% on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split, 89.8% on NTU RGB+D 120 cross-subject split, and 97.0% on NW-UCLA.","tags":[],"title":"InfoGCN: Representation Learning for Human Skeleton-based Action Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seunggeun Chi","Hyung-gun Chi","Stanley Chan","Karthik Ramani","Equal contribution","Equal contribution"],"categories":null,"content":"In proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023\n","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"5af6c22796cfc751ae3623e60fe0a1b5","permalink":"https://sgchi.github.io/publication/icra23/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icra23/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurately estimating the human pose is an essential task for many applications in robotics. However, existing pose estimation methods suffer from poor performance when occlusion occurs. Recent advances in NLP have been very successful in predicting the missing words conditioned on visible words. We draw upon the sentence completion analogy in NLP to guide our model to address occlusions in the pose estimation problem. We propose a novel approach that can mitigate the effect of occlusions motivated by the sentence completion task of NLP. In an analogous manner, we designed our model to reconstruct occluded joints given the visible joints utilizing joint correlations by capturing the implicit joint connectivity through the attention mechanism. In this ork, we propose a POse Relation Transformer (PORT) that captures the global context of the pose using self-attention and a local context by aggregating adjacent joint features. To supervise PORT in learning joint correlations, we guide PORT to reconstruct randomly masked joints, which we call Masked Joint Modeling (MJM). PORT trained with MJM adds to existing keypoint detection methods and successfully refines occlusions. Notably, PORT is a model-agnostic plug-and-play module for pose refinement under occlusion that can be plugged into any keypoint detector with substantially low computational costs. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantage of PORT mitigating the occlusion on the hand and body pose PORT improves the pose estimation accuracy of existing human pose estimation methods by up to 16% with only 5% of additional parameters.w","tags":[],"title":"Pose Relation Transformer: Refine Occlusions for Human Pose Estimation ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Myoung Hoon Ha","Seunggeun Chi","Sangyeop Lee","Yujin Cha","Byung-Ro Moon"],"categories":null,"content":"In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), 2021\n","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"749b2e9dc5c4e2d657a88a7143f744b9","permalink":"https://sgchi.github.io/publication/gecco21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gecco21/","section":"publication","summary":"Portfolio optimization is a control problem whose objective is to find the optimal strategy for the process of selecting the proportions of assets that can provide the maximum return. Conventional approaches formulate the problem as a single Markov decision process and apply reinforcement learning methods to provide solutions. However, it is well known that financial markets involve non-stationary processes, leading to violations of this assumption in these methods. In this work, we reformulate the portfolio optimization problem to deal with the non-stationary nature of financial markets. In our approach, we divide a long-term process into multiple short-term processes to adapt to context changes and consider the portfolio optimization problem as a multitask control problem. Thereafter, we propose an evolutionary meta reinforcement learning approach to search for an initial policy that can quickly adapt to the upcoming target tasks. We model the policies as convolutional networks that can score the match of the patterns in market data charts. Finally, we test our approach using real-world cryptographic currency data and show that it adapts well to the changes in the market and leads to better profitability.","tags":[],"title":"Evolutionary meta reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seunggeun Chi","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
