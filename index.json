Although several studies have focused on encoding a skeleton, less attention has been paid to incorporating this information into the latent representations of human action. This work proposes a learning framework for action recognition, InfoGCN, combining a novel learning objective and encoding method. First, we design an information bottleneck-based learning objective to guide the model to learn an informative but compact latent representation. To provide discriminative information for classifying action, we introduce attention-based graph convolution that captures the context-dependent intrinsic topology of human actions. In addition, we present a multi-modal representation of the skeleton using the relative position of joints, designed to provide complementary spatial information for joints. InfoGCN surpasses the known state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks with the accuracy of 93.0% on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split, 89.8% on NTU RGB+D 120 cross-subject split, and 97.0% on NW-UCLA.","tags":[],"title":"InfoGCN: Representation Learning for Human Skeleton-based Action Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Myoung Hoon Ha","Seunggeun Chi","Sangyeop Lee","Yujin Cha","Byung-Ro Moon"],"categories":null,"content":"In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), 2021\n","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"749b2e9dc5c4e2d657a88a7143f744b9","permalink":"https://jisk984.github.io/publication/gecco21/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gecco21/","section":"publication","summary":"Portfolio optimization is a control problem whose objective is to find the optimal strategy for the process of selecting the proportions of assets that can provide the maximum return. Conventional approaches formulate the problem as a single Markov decision process and apply reinforcement learning methods to provide solutions. However, it is well known that financial markets involve non-stationary processes, leading to violations of this assumption in these methods. In this work, we reformulate the portfolio optimization problem to deal with the non-stationary nature of financial markets. In our approach, we divide a long-term process into multiple short-term processes to adapt to context changes and consider the portfolio optimization problem as a multitask control problem. Thereafter, we propose an evolutionary meta reinforcement learning approach to search for an initial policy that can quickly adapt to the upcoming target tasks. We model the policies as convolutional networks that can score the match of the patterns in market data charts. Finally, we test our approach using real-world cryptographic currency data and show that it adapts well to the changes in the market and leads to better profitability.","tags":[],"title":"Evolutionary meta reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seunggeun Chi","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
